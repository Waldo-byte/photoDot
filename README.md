# photoDot
A full stack website created and designed by me. I developed this website using Java and the Springboot framework.
The goal of this website is to be a cloud storage website, to store photos of users. For the backend I used multiple 
dependencies including the Microsoft Azure dependency to handle the storage of the buckets on Mizrosoft Azure storage
servers. For the database I used hibernate in conjunction with MySQL to create a class based database with full 
entity realtionships and contrainst within keys. For the front end I used the Reactjs library in Javascript.
